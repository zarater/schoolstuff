The Performance Evaluation of Raul

1)	What version of the code provided the best performance? (non-optimized, unrolled 4 times, or unrolled 8 times) 
Unrolled 4 times is the best performance due to the less operations then non-optimized and less unrolling then 8 times. The times with the 8 and 4 were similar in time but the 8 unrolling requires more allocation for memory then the 4th loop unrolling.
2)	Did loop unrolling provided any benefit? 
Yes, the time was a big difference from non optimized. However, in this small code, the microseconds of faster performance wouldn’t do much in the program for the Homework. Only way I see optimizing we learned in class more useful is where speed matters in a bigger amount of code with multiple object files linking together. Then time vs space tradeoff” is more important.
3)	Why do you think that loop unrolling was or was not beneficial in this case? 
5000 ms = 5 seconds
16% faster is a lot of performance difference in a real world application. However, 1 second difference doesn’t do much in my small code. So, I think that percentage wise the code is a lot more efficient but in my code 1 second faster doesn’t make much of a difference.
